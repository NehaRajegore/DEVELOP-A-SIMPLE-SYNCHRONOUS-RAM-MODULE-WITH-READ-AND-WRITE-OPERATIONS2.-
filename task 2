DESCRIPTION OF TASK:In VLSI The goal of this task is to develop a simple Synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) module in Verilog that supports both read and write operations. The RAM should be synchronized with a clock signal to ensure data is written and read at specific clock edges.
Deliverables
Synchronous RAM Verilog Code
A parameterized RAM module with configurable address and data width.
A memory array to store data.
Synchronous read and write operations controlled by a clock signal.
Testbench
A test environment to simulate the RAM module.
Generates clock signals.
Performs read and write operations.
Verifies correct data storage and retrieval.
Simulation Results
Demonstrates that the RAM operates correctly.
Shows waveforms or printed outputs confirming expected behavior.
Functionality Requirements
Clock-based Operation: Data should only be written or read on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
Write Operation: When we (write enable) is high, data from din should be stored at the address addr.
Read Operation: The stored value should be available on dout on every clock cycle.
Memory Array: The RAM should be implemented as an array of registers.
Parameterization: The address width (ADDR_WIDTH) and data width (DATA_WIDTH) should be configurable.
Testing & Validation
Testbench Generates a Clock Signal to drive the synchronous RAM.
Write Data to Specific Addresses, then read back and verify correctness.
Observe Outputs in Waveforms or Console to confirm expected behavior.
